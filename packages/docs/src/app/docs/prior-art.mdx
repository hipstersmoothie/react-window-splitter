# Prior Art

This library is heavily inspired by the following libraries:

- [react-resizable-panels](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels)

This library was build to match the API of `react-resizable-panels` but with a few key differences._createMdxContent

## 1. Mixed Units

In `react-resizable-panels` you can only use percentages to define the size of the panels.
At one point they did have support for pixels but it because it was causing too many bugs.
For the product I work on we need support for pixels since the designs were defined like that.
So I had created my own fork of `react-resizable-panels` that added support for pixels but 
it made the code very complicated and had lots of hard to debug subtle bugs.

This library is built to support both pixels and percentages. You can use either and even
mix and match!

This is mainly accomplished by building on `grid` instead of `flex`.
With `grid` it's much easier to define a complex layout with a mix of percentages, pixels, and other handy units.
The full approach is documented in the source code.

## 2. Controlled Panels

`react-resizable-panels` has support for collapsible panels but it's very hard to control it.
Also having a panel collapsed by default was pretty tricky to do.
Personally I like Radix's pattern for controlled components so I matched that here in the collapse API:

- Just `collapsible` prop => The `PanelGroup` will control the collapsed state
- `collapsible` and `onCollapseChange` prop => The `PanelGroup` will control the collapsed state, but will notify you when it changes
- `collapsible`, `collapsed` and `onCollapseChange` prop => The `PanelGroup` defers the collapse state fully to you. If you don't update wherever you are storing `collapsed` when `onCollapseChange` is called the panel's collapsed state will not update
- `defaultCollapsed` prop => Render the panel collapsed by default, but let the `PanelGroup` control the collapsed state 

## 3. Cookie Based Layout Persistance (SSR)

`react-resizable-panels` has support for persisting the state of the layout to `localStorage` or a custom method.
You can make it work but it's not very convenient.
Since the easiest method for storing user settings for server use is cookies, `react-window-splitter` has [support for persisting the state of the layout to `cookie` storage.](/docs/examples/persistance#cookie-storage)
